Hi, this project is an imitation of a real Donkey Kong game using SDL library in C++. You can move mario using arrows (up and down on the ladders only) and jump using space.
You can gain points by going on a new level (platform), by jumping above the barrels and by picking up the items.
You can win by reaching highest platform (your score and time are displayed on a screen) and lose by touching barrel.
